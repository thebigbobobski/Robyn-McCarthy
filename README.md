# My Data Analysis Portfolio
Hi there 👋
This is a repository I've created to display my capabilites in Data Analytics, share my projects and track my progress in Data Analytics and programming. 
My five major projects are focused on showing skills in 
- Python
- SQL
- Tableau/Power Bi
- Netlogo (Social Simulations)

Project 1:
This project aims to look at disease control. In this project, I will take specific parameters of a contagious disease (Covid 19) and simulate the infection transmition by assigning it parameters based on rate of transmition, severity of symptoms, age, gender, occupancy, as well as various likelihoods such as likelihood of isolating, likelihood of practicing hygiene, etc.

Project 2:
Traffic/weather data. Cross comparison of likelihood of vehicle collisions/road accidents in areas with similar weather patterns.

Project 3:
Social media web scraping. Scrape data using API's and build ML models to categorise information retrieved. Statistically analyse to determine whether specific category values had statistical significance to future post frequency. 

Project 4:
This project will focus on basic end to end skills, cleaning, analysing and interpreting data, as well as filling in missing values.

Project 5: 
This project will focus on basic data analysis skills but using financial data.
